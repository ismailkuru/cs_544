We propose an application layer protocol for remote automobile utility control, \textsf{RAUC}. Automobiles are getting more and more complex and there exists a great shift in controlling cars with softwares. Softwares are designed for controlling utilities in an automobile such as radio-controller, ac-controller, side-mirror-controller and car-internals-report etc. Smart devices are getting more and more popular and they are used as a tool in many domains with help of domain specific softwares where controlling vehicles is one of them. Our protocol enables a remote user, the client to connect to a centralized server, for controlling his one of vehicles utilities with his smart device. In this paper, we explain the protocol, \textsf{RAUC}, from many aspects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Client and Server communication through deterministic finite state machine, \textsf{Protocol-DFA}. 
\item Common themes : \textsf{Addressing}, \textsf{Flow Control}, \textsf{PDU-Message-Definition}, \textsf{Error Control}
\item \textsf{Extensibility}
\item \textsf{Quality of Service}
  \item \textsf{Security Implications}
  \end{itemize}
