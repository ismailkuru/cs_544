\maketitle
This document specifies the packages and files in the RAUC protocol implementation code base with explanation of the following requirements
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt STATEFUL}
  \item {\tt CONCURRENT}
  \item {\tt SERVICE}
  \item {\tt CLIENT}
  \item {\tt UI}
  \end{itemize}

The following sections include links to the explanations of the requirements in files at code base in git-hub repository.
\section{Client}
\subsection{Client.java}Purpose of this file is provide functionality to initialize a connection to the server. It uses GUI functinolity provided by ClientGUI.java to control the client side capabilities. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt CLIENT} : requirement is satisfied by Client.java in a way that it provides instantiates Client object with parametrized Server port number and Server address. [ref to Client 50-58]
  \item {\tt CONCURRENT} : This requirement is satisfied by Client.java in a way that it spawns a Listener thread to process Servers responses [ref to Client 106-109] right after establishing connection with server [ref to Client 81-101] through SSL sockets.
\end{itemize}
           
\subsection{ClientGUI.java} Client.java handles interactions with user through ClientGUI.java object handle, [ref Client 35-36]. ClientGUI.java uses \textsf{javax.swing} GUI objects to handle user interaction and inputs [ref ClientGUI.java 23-34].
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt UI} : ClientGUI.java abstracts the way communication is handled between Client and Server. A GUI based on \textsf{javax.swing} panels is provided to user for providing inputs which are used as arguments for buildiing a message to be sent to Server, [ref ClientGUI 102-112]. In addition, user authentication is provided with the inputs through Login-GUI [ref to ClientGUI.java 65-85]. 
 \item {\tt CLIENT} : is relavant to CLientGUI.java because this file enables you to indicate Server address and Server port number. [ref CLientGUI.java 40-60]
\end{itemize}

\section{Server}
\subsection{Server.java}This file is main driver for performing server functionalities.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt SERVICE} : Main class for starting a server. The server is hardcoded to port 1500. The server keeps client connections in a map [ref Server.java 23].
\item {\tt CONCURRENT} : The server initializes a connection listener which handles incoming connections, [ref 75-95]. It spawns a new thread, ConnectionThread , for handling each different client connection. This makes Server to handle multiple connections at a time , [ref Server.java 80-85].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ServerGUI.java}This file includes implementation of GUI which aims to provide server's logs.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt UI} : Entire file's relevant requirement is satisfying UI.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ConnectionThread.java} This files includes the thread implementation aiming to handle server communication to the client. Main server drivers Server.java spawns ConnectionThread for each client communication.
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\tt SERVICE} : Main thread to handle server communication to the client, parse and respond to the client messages etc. [ref Server.java 180-198]
\end{itemize}
  
\section{DFAs}

All functions([ref ClientSpecDFA \textsf{sendInit}, receiveAuth, sendEstablished, receiveAuth, receiveWaitcmd, receiveWaitqry]) inherited from DFASpec.java defines the valid transition relation between client side states, setting state of client dfa in each of these functions, triggered by \textsf{Message m}. 
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt SERVICE} : Server side functionality is specified in this file.
  \item {\tt STATEFUL} : Entire file defines valid client side states and admissible valid transitions between these states. All functions([ref ServerSpecDFA sendAuth, sendWaitcmd, sendWaitqry, receiveInit, receiveEstablished]) inherited from DFASpec.java defines the valid transition relation between server side states, setting state of server dfa in each of these functions, triggered by \textsf{Message m}. 
  \end{itemize}
\subsection{DFASpec.java}This is an abstract class which defines methods to be implemented by the client and server for the operations to apply at any given state of the protocol ,[TODO]

      \item {\tt STATEFUL} This file defines the Message Type  which is partly a part of being statefulness. The reason is that Message Type is tightly coupled with Client/Server DFAs' state [ref to one for the switch case in message] when they are processing the message taken from other end. [ref HeaderChunk.java 6]
     \end{itemize}   

  \section{Components} All files under this folder serves for the implementation of representation of an automobile, components of the automobile and commands that are applied on the status of these components. All of them satisfy the {\tt SERVICE} requirement.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Automobile.java : This file includes the representation of the Automobile object.
  \item Command.java : Commands are operations applied on states of components of an automobile. Command objects are generated from Message objects, [ref to Command.java 27-28] and applied on components of an automobile. It is part of the protocol's service.
  \item Component.java :  This file includes abstract class for a component that can be part of an automobile controlled by the protocol. It is part of the protocol's service because Component.java specifies that each component sub type, ex:AC.java, needs to implement \textsf{applyCommand}, [ref to lines applyCommand], which enables applying a command to change component's state of attributes [ref to 54 - 60 AC.java]. 
  \item ComponentType.java :

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt SERVICE}: Authentication of an user with user name and password, [ref 4-5 User.java],  is one important part of the protocol's service. Each Client object is created with its user name and password, [ref 41-70 Client.java] and creates/sends authenticate message, UserAuthMessage.java [ref 112 Client.java], 
    \end{itemize}
